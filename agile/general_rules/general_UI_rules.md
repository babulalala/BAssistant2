# General UI rules

## Reauired field
* If this field is required, there must be a red asterist before field label to indicate this field is required.
* UI must perform first level validation of this field once user unfocuses the field.
* If the value didn't pass validation, there must be a red boarder around the input field and tooltips indecate the error.
